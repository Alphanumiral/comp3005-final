# comp3005-final
to run the program download all the files and put them into a folder/directory
navigate to the directory using command prompt or terminal or whatever you have, and do npm install which will install all the dependencies
you must also extract the database tar file and restore it into pgadmin
the server.js file has a password on line 15, i set mine as 'abc' but it might be different on your computer so you should set it to whatever your password is to access the database
with that set up you can run node server.js in the command prompt to start the server and go to localhost:3000 to see the page
some key notes, this program is not entirely complete
you may have to press on things several times to get it to run, i'm not sure why
the nagivation between pages is not set up, but the main ones of note are
localhost:3000/ is the main page from where you can access search, list, and auth (log in)
localhost:3000/cart is the cart
localhost:3000/track is where you can track ids
report is incomplete
this entire thing is super scuffed and not made well, i am sorry for your eyes
if you can't get it to work, please ask for a demo
it was not tested very extensively and there's still a bunch of trash test stuff in the database
this part was more work than anticipated 
i (andrew) greatly enjoyed the class and as a result i'm sorry this part is so bad
